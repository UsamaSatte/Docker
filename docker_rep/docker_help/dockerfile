Explanation of Each Instruction:

	1.	FROM ubuntu:latest: Specifies the base image (Ubuntu in this case).
	2.	LABEL: Adds metadata (maintainer and description) to the image.
	3.	WORKDIR /app: Sets the working directory inside the container to /app. If the directory doesnâ€™t exist, it will be created.
	4.	RUN: Executes commands to update package lists, install curl and vim, create a /app/logs directory,
	 and prints a message indicating installation is complete.
	5.	USER: Creates a new user named newuser and switches to that user.
	6.	CMD ["bash"]: Sets the default command to start a Bash shell when the container is run.
